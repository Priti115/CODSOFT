### Task 1: Summary Titanic Survival Prediction
Titanic Survival Prediction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information such as passenger class, age, sex, and ticket fare. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering were applied before training machine learning models. The model evaluation included accuracy measurement and optimization techniques for improved predictions. This notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and analysis, serving as a step toward understanding predictive modeling.
